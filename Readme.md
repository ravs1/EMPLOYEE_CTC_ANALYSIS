# Employee CTC Analysis 

In this project we have been provided with the data of employees with different CTC packages and their department. What we want to analyse is the employees both male and female who earns heighest in each department . 

This problem seems to be a simple approach if done in RDBMS but , in hadoop we have to do some serious tweakings in the Partition class .
